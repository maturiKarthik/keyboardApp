# keyboardApp



This app was built for people to be more productive with the new tools they works with in there day to day life or in there company. I personally came across a situation where i was forced to work with a tool which i never hear of and never worked with .Therefore i created this app which gives you the keyboard shortcuts and to be more productive in there work.
